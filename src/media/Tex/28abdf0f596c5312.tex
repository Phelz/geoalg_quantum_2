``Mathematics is taken for granted in the physics curriculumâ€”a body of \\n \
                        immutable truths to be assimilated and applied. The profound influence \\n \
                        of mathematics on our conceptions of the physical world is never analyzed. \\n \
                        The possibility that mathematical tools used today were invented to solve \\n \
                        problems in the past and might not be well suited for current problems \\n \
                        is never considered.''
